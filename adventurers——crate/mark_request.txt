# Explorer Mark Request

(You should put an [X] in boxes with completed features.
Lines starting with ">" are additional comments.)

[X] There is a player is displayed on the screen.

[X] The player can be moved by pressing keys
> You can use the Up/Down/Left/Right keys to move around. (CHANGE THIS LINE IF IT IS NOT CORRECT)

[X] When the player tries to move off the screen, the screen follows them.

[X] The viewport does not necessarily always move when the player does.

[X] There are at least 5 block types (i.e different coloured blocks).

[X] The layout of the map is specified by a file on the filesystem.

[X] There is a 'barrier' block. When the player attempts to pass through it, they cannot.

[X] There is a 'water' block. When the player walks through the 10th block in a row, they die and the game ends.

[X] There is a 'sign' block. When the player walks over the sign block, a specified message is shown.

[X] There are 'objects' in my game -- when a player walks over the object, it disappears.

[X] There is a quests system in my game.
[X] The quests system is in a seperate module or crate to the game.

[X] The first quest (walking over sand blocks) is implemented.
[X] The 'q' key shows the progress of my user in this quest.
[X] The 'r' key resets progress of my user in this quest.

[X] The second quest (collecting five objects of one type, then three of another)
[X] The 'q' key shows the progress of my user in this quest.
[X] The 'r' key resets progress of my user in this quest.

[X] The third quest (at least two of the three subquests) is implemented.
[X] The 'q' key shows the progress of my user in this quest.
[X] The 'r' key resets progress of my user in this quest.

[ ] My quests system is designed to make it easy for a developer to add more quests.

## How to Run My Program

Assuming we have taken your crate, without any compilation; what commands will start the game?

> $ cargo run path/to/map.ron first_quest
> $ cargo run path/to/map.ron second_quest
> $ cargo run path/to/map.ron third_quest

## Design Excellence

During the assignment we make suggestions for "design excellence". Please list all those
things you did, and where we can find them in your program.

> - TODO
I implement three quest in the game, which make the task completion has been checked.

If you made any other design choices you think demonstrate an equivalent level
of design excellence, please list them below (including where to find them).
Note, we suggest you check with a tutor that your design is in fact excellent
before adding something below:

## Design Limitations

If you made any design decisions which you now regret making; but don't to go back and change them,
let us know here. You can make up your design marks by acknowledging up to 5 things you would do
differently now.

> - TODO
1. I try to use trait in the Quest System Features part, but my three questions have different criteria for judging whether the task is completed, so I didn't use trait.
I believe that if I set all the judgment conditions and let three different tasks use only a part of so many judgment conditions according to the usage scenario, I can achieve all the quest tasks through traits. And this will facilitate the subsequent addition of new quest tasksã€‚

2. I use a emoji char ðŸ’­ to represent the 'Sign'. But I found the icon of this emoticon is a bit big. If the player icon move to the ðŸ’­'s right, although the player is display as usual, but the ðŸ’­ may cover it since it was big.But this situation is no problem in the other three directions.
I think the player icon is display normally and the ðŸ’­ is suitable to be a Sign icon, so I did not change it.
